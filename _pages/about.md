I'm a junior student majoring in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at Zhejiang University. Under the guidance of [Prof. Hanzhi Ma](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/team/teacherinfo/2063), I completed one-year national SRTP titled *Research on High-Speed Signal Model Based on Machine Learning Methods and Multi-objective Optimiation*.  
I had one excellent experience with [Prof. Jixing Cao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/caojixing) during summer research of ZJUI in 2025.   
Now I'm a visiting student in research group of [Prof. Huan Zhang](https://www.huan-zhang.com/) at UIUC.

My research interests include:
* **Topic 1**: Multimodal AI
* **Topic 2**: LLM Reasoning
* **Topic 3**: Autonomous driving
